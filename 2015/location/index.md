			<p>It wouldn’t make sense to host a Farmhouse Festival anywhere but on an actual farm. Luckily UBC has one, so that’s where Farmhouse Fest will be.</p>
			<p>The UBC Farm is a 24 hectare teaching and learning farm located on the south end of UBC’s main Point Grey campus.</p>

		<div class="panel">

			<p>The field playing host to Farmhouse Festival is a large, grassy area including a small apple orchard, surrounded by towering conifer forest. We encourage you to bring a blanket, and spread out to enjoy your afternoon.</p>
			<p>Plus, there will be a Farmers’ Market held adjacently immediately before the Farmhouse Fest. Peruse the market then wander over to try some beers and have a picnic.</p>
