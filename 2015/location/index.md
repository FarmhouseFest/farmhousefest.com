				<p>It wouldn’t make sense to host a Farmhouse Festival anywhere but on an actual farm. Luckily UBC has one, so that’s where Farmhouse Festival will be.</p>

		<p>The UBC Farm is a 24 hectare teaching and learning farm located on the south end of UBC’s main Point Grey campus. It’s easy to get to by car, bike or transit (route C20 connects the UBC Loop to the Farm Gates every 30 minutes).</p>

		<p>Plus, there will be a Farmers’ Market held there immediately before the Farmhouse Festival. Peruse the market, buy some lunch, then wander over to try some beers and have a picnic.</p>
