	<h2>Festival Info</h2>

	<div class="panel-2">
		<div>
			<p>The surroundings at Farmhouse Festival are an important part of the event, and hosting it on UBC’s 24 hectare model farm completes the atmosphere. The farm is located on the south end of UBC’s main Point Grey campus, easily accessible from central Vancouver.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>The farm’s field is a large, grassy area surrounded by evergreens within arms length of a sustainable working farm. We encourage you to bring a blanket, and spread out on the grass or in the small apple orchard to enjoy your afternoon. There will also be multiple covered seating areas if you’d like some shade.</p>

		<h3>How Much are Tickets?</h3>
		<p>Tickets are now sold out but a small amount have been held back for breweries. To claim yours if we release those, get on the waitlist <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/4th-annual-farmhouse-fest-invitational-tickets-43046977669/">here</a>. All ticket sales are final.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Entry, naturally</li>
			<li>A stylish tasting glass</li>
			<li>All-inclusive access to all beer and cider</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Do I need to bring my ticket?</h3>
		<p>Yes, please bring your EventBrite ticket as a PDF or in Passbook. (You can print it out too, but try to save paper if possible.) We will be scanning your ticket for entry. Those without tickets and valid government-issued photo ID will not be granted entry.</p>

		<h3>Can I ask for a refund on a ticket I bought?</h3>
		<p>Sorry, no. All ticket sales are final. If circumstances have changed and you're unable to attend, we will honour tickets that have been transferred.</p>

		<h3>Will there be food?</h3>
		<p>Absolutely, there will be multiple food options offering great selection for vegetarians and omnivores alike, full lineup to be announced soon. You may carry in sealed or empty water bottles and small food items.</p>

		<h3>Will there be non-alcoholic options?</h3>
		<p>Aside from plentiful water, we're working on other tasty non-alcoholic options this year.</p>

		<h3>Will there be gluten-free options?</h3>
		<p>Drink-wise, there will be plenty of cider options this year along with sodas. As we announce our food lineup, please consult their menus.</p>

		<h3>Will there be ATMs?</h3>
		<p>No. Most food vendors and our merchandise booth will be able to accept credit cards. If you would rather deal with cash, please bring enough to cover your day.</p>

		<h3>Can I smoke at Farmhouse Fest?</h3>
		<p>UBC Farm is a strictly no smoking venue. If you do feel the need to light up, please use the designated smoking area outside the venue, and dispose of your used cigarette butts in the provided bins.</p>

		<h3>Is there a code of conduct?</h3>
		<p>Farmhouse Fest promotes a safe, enjoyable environment for everyone involved. Harassment &amp; abuse of any kind whether verbal or physical will result in immediate ejection from the festival without refund.</p>

		<h3>Where is Farmhouse Fest being held?</h3>
		<p>At the UBC Farm - 3461 Ross Drive, Vancouver, BC, Canada.</p>

		<h3>Which bus do I take to get there?</h3>
		<p>Get to the UBC Loop however you can (99 B-Line, 25, 33, 41, 49, etc), then take shuttle C20, which runs every 30 minutes and will drop you off at the gates of the UBC Farm. Or get off at UBC Loop Bay 8; walk 0.61 kms south on West 16th, turn left at the first street East Mall; right onto Ross Drive.</p>

		<h3>Is there parking?</h3>
		<p>We would strongly suggest taking public transit. If you drive in with a Car2Go or Evo, please ensure you park in an approved zone as parking at UBC is somewhat complicated for these two services, and you <em>will</em> be towed if you park outside of an approved zone.</p>

		<h3>Can I bring my kids? Dogs?</h3>
		<p>This is a licensed 19+ event. The farm offers limited space which we'd prefer to maximize for attendees, and animals aren't permitted on the farm. So unfortunately, no to both kids and dogs.</p>

		<h3>Are there in &amp; out privileges?</h3>
		<p>Yes. Your wristband allows you to come and go from the Fest as you please. But it must be on your wrist to get back in. And we’d hope this goes without saying, but you are not allowed to enter or exit the venue with open alcohol.</p>

		<h3>Will there be tickets available at the door?</h3>
		<p>No, sorry.</p>

		<h3>What happens if it rains?</h3>
		<p>Farmhouse Fest will proceed rain or shine. In addition to plentiful open air seating, plenty of covered seating will be provided. If the weather looks uncertain, make sure to bring an umbrella and dress accordingly.</p>

		<h3>What do I do if I lose or break my glass?</h3>
		<p>Farmhouse Fest glasses are available for purchase at the merchandise booth.</p>

		<h3>Will there be first aid available?</h3>
		<p>St John Ambulance will be on-site near the entrance to the festival.</p>

		<h3>Who's running this thing?</h3>
		<p>Your friendly neighbourhood organizing crew consists of Jonathan Evans (<a href="https://twitter.com/JonnyBeers">@jonnybeers</a>), Dave Shea (<a href="https://twitter.com/mezzoblue">@mezzoblue</a>), and Matt Kump (<a href="https://twitter.com/kump">@kump</a>).</p>

		<h3>Can I be in a promo photo?</h3>
		<p>By entering the field, you consent to your voice, name, and/or likeness being used, without compensation, in photos and videos for use in any and all media, whether now known or hereafter devised, for eternity, and you release Farmhouse Fest and its directors, successors, assigns and licensees from any liability whatsoever of any nature. Whew, thanks for making it this far. We only want to use great photos for promoting future events, but our lawyer made us include all the rest.</p>
