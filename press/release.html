	<h3 class="header-alt">Canada’s premier saison &amp; wild ale festival returns to Vancouver July 7th, 2018.</h3>

	<p>Farmhouse Fest is a celebration of saisons, wild and sour ales that returns for its third year to the scenic UBC Farm on Saturday, July 7th, 2018.</p>

	<p>Unique amongst beer festivals, Farmhouse Fest believes that good beer can be as complex and rewarding as the best Bordeaux or Islay malt. We focus exclusively on a narrow range of beer styles and meticulously curate a high-quality selection of limited experimental beer from select local and international breweries.</p>

	<p>More than just excellent beer, it’s about being in an interesting place with great people. It’s about stretching out on a sun-drenched field and sipping a beer made with passion and craft. It’s about being as excited for great farmhouse ales as the brewers are.</p>

	<h3 class="header-alt">The full story</h3>

	<p>Featuring over 50 hand-selected breweries from around the world, Farmhouse Fest is an international festival right here in Vancouver.</p>

	<p>We obsessively focus on a narrow range of beer styles: Saisons, Wild Ales, and Sours. Our goal is quality over quantity, and as such we intentionally invite only those breweries who are quality-driven, experimental, and have a track record of producing great farmhouse beers.</p>

	<p>The food selection is also curated, with some of Vancouver’s best food vendors on-site serving up a wide variety of unique international cuisine. Past years have included saltimbocca, west coast tacos, sous vide comfort food, modern Filipino, and high quality sandwiches.</p>

	<p>The field playing host to Farmhouse Festival is situated on a 24 hectare model farm located on UBC’s main Point Grey campus. Picture a spacious grassy area surrounded by evergreens within arms length of a sustainable working farm.</p>

	<p>By capping our tickets at comfortable numbers, we intentionally avoid the elbow-to-elbow crush of an oversold event. There’s plenty of room to spread out a blanket on the grass and within the small on-site apple orchard, or toss some beanbags in between the rustic barrels and hay bales dotted around the field.</p>
