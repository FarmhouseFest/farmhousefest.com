<p>Farmhouse Fest is a celebration of farmhouse-style beers and ciders. Dry and refreshing to funky and complex, these are products made with a passion for the highest-quality ingredients and a no-shortcuts approach given the proper time to mature and evolve into something wonderful.</p>

<p>Set on the idyllic working farm at UBC, the atmosphere is just as important as the pours. Whether relaxing on a picnic blanket or catching some shade under the big tent, our spacious natural setting offers unique experiences for a festival of this nature.</p>
