		<h2>Attendee?</h2>
		<p>For general inquiries, fire us an email at info@farmhousefest.com. We’ll try to turn around an answer in a reasonably quick time frame, but bear with us if it takes a bit longer because we're a small crew. You can also reach us on Facebook and Twitter. </p>

		<h2>Vendor?</h2>
		<p>The field playing host to Farmhouse Festival is a large, grassy area surrounded by evergreens within arms length of a sustainable working farm. We encourage you to ?bring a blanket, and spread out on the grass or in the small apple orchard to enjoy your afternoon. There will also be multiple covered seating areas if you’d like some shade.</p>
