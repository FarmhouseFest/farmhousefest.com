				<p>Sadly, Farmhouse Fest will not take place on our originally-scheduled date of July 11th this year.</p>
				<p>We are closely following BC provincial health guidance as the current pandemic situation develops, but it's abundantly clear that large events will not be permitted by this summer.</p>
				<p>If current restrictions are lifted with enough lead time to plan the quality of festival you have come to expect, we will give it our best to try and run Farmhouse Fest in the fall instead. We can't promise it will happen this year, but stay tuned and we will update the usual channels as we learn more.</p>
