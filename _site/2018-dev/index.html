					<p>The surroundings at Farmhouse Festival are an important part of the event, and hosting it on UBC's 24 hectar model farm completes the atmosphere. UBC is accessible from central Vancouver and just so happens to have one on campus. The UBC Farm is located on the south end of UBC’s main Point Grey campus.</p>
					<p>The farm's field is a large, grassy area surrounded by evergreens within arms length of a sustainable working farm. We encourage you to bring a blanket, and spread out on the grass or in the small apple orchard to enjoy your afternoon. There will also be multiple covered seating areas if you’d like some shade.</p>

		<div class="panel">
			<h3>Taking Transit</h3>
			<p>Route C18 &amp; C20 service the UBC Farm gate every 30 minutes, taking you to the UBC Loop, where connections are available to a wide array of bus routes.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="panel">
			<h3>Car Sharing</h3>
			<p>Car2Go and Evo are a great way to get to the UBC Farm in the morning, but UBC has strict parking restrictions on each that should be heeded; cars parked out of designated zones <em>will</em> be towed.</p>

		<div class="panel">
			<h3>When is Farmhouse Fest</h3>
			<p>Saturday, July 7th 2018. 12pm - 6pm, early entry starts at 11am. Gates close at 5pm, last call is 5:30pm. The field must be cleared after 6pm.</p>

			<h3>How Much are Tickets?</h3>
			<p>Tickets are $55 plus taxes (or $75 for early-access tickets). You can buy them <a href="https://farmhousefest2017.eventbrite.ca/">here</a>. All ticket sales are final.</p>

			<h3>What do I get with my ticket?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Entry, naturally</li>
				<li>A stylish tasting glass</li>
				<li>5 tokens (4oz pour per token), or 10 tokens with Early Admission</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Do I need to bring my ticket?</h3>
			<p>Yes, please bring your EventBrite ticket as a printout, a PDF, or in Passbook. We will be scanning your ticket for entry. Those without tickets will not be granted entry.</p>

			<h3>How much are additional tokens?</h3>
			<p>$10 will get you 6 tokens, good for a 4oz pour each. Every beer we pour will cost a single token. We accept Visa, Mastercard and good old cash for token sales.</p>

			<h3>Can I ask for a refund on a ticket I bought?</h3>
			<p>Sorry, no. All ticket sales are final. If circumstances have changed and you're unable to attend, we will honour tickets that have been transferred.</p>

			<h3>Will there be food?</h3>
			<p>Absolutely, there will be multiple food options offering great selection for vegetarians and omnivores alike, full lineup to be announced soon. No outside food or beverages will be permitted on site, with the exception of sealed or empty water bottles.</p>

			<h3>Will there be non-alcoholic options?</h3>
			<p>Aside from plentiful water, we're working on other tasty non-alcoholic options this year.</p>

			<h3>Will there be gluten-free options?</h3>
			<p>Drink-wise, there will be plenty of cider options this year along with sodas. As we announce our food lineup, please consult their menus.</p>

			<h3>Will there be bathrooms and hand wash stations?</h3>
			<p>Of course. We'll be increasing the number of portable toilets this year.</p>

			<h3>Will there be ATMs?</h3>
			<p>No. Tokens will be available for purchase by credit card, and most of the food trucks will be able to accept credit cards. If you would rather deal with cash, please bring enough to cover your day.</p>

			<h3>Can I smoke at Farmhouse Fest?</h3>
			<p>UBC Farm is a strict no smoking venue. If you do feel the need to light up, please use the designated smoking area outside the venue, and dispose of your used cigarette butts in the provided bins.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="panel">

			<h3>Where is Farmhouse Fest being held?</h3>
			<p>At the UBC Farm - 3461 Ross Drive, Vancouver, BC, Canada.</p>

			<h3>Which bus do I take to get there?</h3>
			<p>Get to the UBC Loop however you can (99 B-Line, 25, 33, 41, 49, etc), then take shuttle C20, which runs every 30 minutes and will drop you off at the gates of the UBC Farm. Or get off at UBC Loop Bay 8; walk 0.61 kms south on West 16th, turn left at the first street East Mall; right onto Ross Drive.</p>

			<h3>Is there parking?</h3>
			<p>There isn't much. We would really prefer that you take public transit anyway. If you take a Car2Go or Evo in, please ensure you park in an approved zone as parking at UBC is somewhat complicated for these two services, and you <em>will</em> be towed if you park outside of an approved zone.</p>

			<h3>Can I bring my kids? Dogs?</h3>
			<p>This is a licensed 19+ event. The farm offers limited space which we'd prefer to maximize for attendees, and animals aren't permitted on the farm. So unfortunately, no.</p>

			<h3>Are there in &amp; out privileges?</h3>
			<p>Yes. Your wristband allows you to come and go from the Fest as you please. But it must be on your wrist to get back in. And we’d hope this goes without saying, but you are not allowed to enter or exit the venue with open alcohol.</p>

			<h3>Will there be tickets available at the door?</h3>
			<p>No. As in previous years, Farmhouse Fest is likely to be fully sold out by the time of the festival, so make sure to buy a ticket online now if you plan to come.</p>

			<h3>What happens if it rains?</h3>
			<p>Farmhouse Fest will proceed rain or shine. In addition to plentiful open air seating, plenty of covered seating will be provided. If the weather looks uncertain, make sure to bring an umbrella and dress accordingly.</p>

			<h3>What do I do if I lose or break my glass?</h3>
			<p>The Farmhouse Fest glass is available for purchase at the merchandise booth.</p>

			<h3>Will there be first aid available?</h3>
			<p>St John Ambulance will be on-site near the entrance to the festival.</p>

			<h3>Who's running this thing?</h3>
			<p>Your friendly neighbourhood organizing crew consists of Jonathan Evans (<a href="https://twitter.com/JonnyBeers">@jonnybeers</a>), Dave Shea (<a href="https://twitter.com/mezzoblue">@mezzoblue</a>), and Matt Kump (<a href="https://twitter.com/kump">@kump</a>).</p>

			<h3>Can I be in a promo photo?</h3>
			<p>By entering the field, you consent to your voice, name, and/or likeness being used, without compensation, in photos and videos for use in any and all media, whether now known or hereafter devised, for eternity, and you release Farmhouse Fest and its directors, successors, assigns and licensees from any liability whatsoever of any nature. Whew, thanks for making it this far. We only want to use great photos for promoting future events, but our lawyer made us include all the rest.</p>
