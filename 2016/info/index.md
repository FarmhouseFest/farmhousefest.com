		    <h2>When is Farmhouse Fest?</h2>
			<p class="block">Saturday, June 18th 2016. 12pm - 6pm.</p>

		    <h2>How much are tickets?</h2>
			<p class="block">Tickets are $55 plus taxes. You can buy them <a href="{{ site.ticket_link }}">here</a>. All ticket sales are final.</p>

		    <h2>What do I get for $55 plus tax?</h2>
		    <ul class="block">
				<li>Entry</li>
				<li>A stylish tasting glass</li>
				<li>5 tokens (4oz pour per token)</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Do I need to bring my ticket?</h2>
			<p class="block">Yes, please bring your EventBrite ticket as a printout, a PDF, or in Passbook. We will be scanning your ticket on entry.</p>

		    <h2>How much are additional tokens?</h2>
			<p class="block">$10 will get you 6 tokens, good for a 4oz pour each. Every beer we pour will cost a single token.</p>

		    <h2>Can I ask for a refund on a ticket I bought?</h2>
			<p class="block">Sorry, no. All ticket sales are final. If circumstances have changed and you're unable to attend, we will honour tickets that have been transferred.</p>

		    <h2>Where is the Farmhouse Fest being held?</h2>
			<p class="block">At the <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/place/UBC+Farm/@49.250699,-123.237457,14z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x548672d4799fae1f:0xe9b92d59922eb0d">UBC Farm - 3461 Ross Drive</a>, Vancouver</p>

		    <h2>What bus do I take to get there?</h2>
			<p class="block">Get to the UBC Loop however you can (99 B-Line, 25, 33, 41, 49, etc), then take shuttle C20, which runs every 30 minutes and will drop you off at the gates of the UBC Farm. Or get off at UBC Loop Bay 8; walk 0.61 kms south on West 16th, turn left at the first street East Mall; right onto Ross Drive.</p>

		    <h2>Is there parking?</h2>
			<p class="block">There isn't much. We would really prefer that you take public transit anyway.</p>

		    <h2>Can I bring my kids? Dogs? </h2>
			<p class="block">This is a licensed 19+ event. The farm offers limited space which we'd prefer to maximize for attendees, and animals aren't permitted on the farm. So unfortunately, no.</p>

		    <h2>Will you be serving food?</h2>
			<p class="block">Yes, there will be multiple food booths at the festival this year, offering great selection for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. No outside food or beverages will be permitted on site, with the exception of sealed or empty water bottles.</p>

		    <h2>Are there in &amp; out privileges?</h2>
			<p class="block">Yes. Your wristband allows you to come and go from the Fest as you please. But it must be on your wrist to get back in. And we&#8217;d hope this goes without saying, but you are not allowed to enter or exit the venue with open alcohol.</p>

		    <h2>Can I smoke at Farmhouse Fest?</h2>
			<p class="block">UBC Farm is a strict no smoking venue. If you do feel the need to light up, please use the designated smoking area outside the venue, and dispose of your used cigarette butts in the provided bins.</p>

		    <h2>What happens if it rains?</h2>
			<p class="block">Farmhouse Fest will proceed rain or shine. In addition to plentiful open air seating, a lot more covered seating will be provided this year, to block out the blazing sun if nothing else. If the weather looks uncertain, make sure to bring an umbrella.</p>

		    <h2>Who's running this thing?</h2>
		    <p class="block">Your friendly neighbourhood organizing crew consists of <a href="https://twitter.com/JonnyBeers">@jonnybeers</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mezzoblue">@mezzoblue</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HopsCanary">@hopscanary</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kump">@kump</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/foodandbier">@foodandbier</a>.</p>
