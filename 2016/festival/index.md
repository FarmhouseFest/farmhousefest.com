		    <p>Farmhouse Fest is about more than just excellent beer, though it is very much about that too. It&#8217;s about having excellent beer in an excellent place with excellent people. It&#8217;s about stretching out on a sun drenched field and sipping a beer made with passion and craft. It&#8217;s about being as excited for great farmhouse ales as the brewers are. That&#8217;s why Farmhouse Fest works the way it does.</p>

		<div class="panel dark">
			<p>The festival takes place on UBC Farm, which is full of open space and is surrounded by nature. A beautiful, relaxing setting is the perfect place to spend a sunny afternoon. On top of that, we&#8217;ll also have plenty of water, non-alcoholic refreshments, shade, and food for you to keep yourself hydrated, cool, and fed throughout the day. <a href="/2016/info/">More details</a></p>

			Farmhouse Fest specializes in Saisons, Sours, and Wild Ales. You won&#8217;t find your traditional IPAs, Stouts, Light Lagers, or Pale Ales here.</p>

			<p>What you will find are limited, vintage, or exclusive farmhouse ales and ciders that are guaranteed to keep your palate happy. To do that, we&#8217;re bringing in some of the best breweries from around BC and the world to show what they can do.</p>
