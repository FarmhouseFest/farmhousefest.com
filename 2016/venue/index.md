		    <p>Your surroundings at Farmhouse Festival are an important part of the atmosphere, and hosting it on a farm just makes sense. UBC is accessible from central Vancouver and just so happens to have one on campus.</p>

			<p>The UBC Farm is a 24 hectare model farm located on the south end of UBCâ€™s main Point Grey campus.</p>

		<div class="panel dark">
			<p>The field playing host to Farmhouse Festival is a large, grassy area surrounded by evergreens within arms length of a sustainable working farm. We encourage you to bring a blanket, and spread out on the grass or in the small apple orchard to enjoy your afternoon. There will also be multiple covered seating areas if you&#8217;d like some shade.</p>
